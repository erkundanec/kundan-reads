    "For example, the Transformer architecture was a significant milestone in NLP, but its performance in time series forecasting remained average, until PatchTST was proposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, large language models (LLMs) are being actively developed and have demonstrated impressive generalization and reasoning capabilities in NLP. Thus, it is worth exploring the idea of repurposing an LLM for time series forecasting, such that we can benefit from the capabilities of those large pre-trained models.\n",
    "\n",

Instead, we teach the LLM to take an input sequence of time steps and output forecasts over a certain horizon. This means that the LLM itself stays unchanged.\n",

These patches are then sent through a reprogramming layer that essentially translate the forecasting task into a language task.

Here, each patch becomes an input token so it reduces the number of tokens from $L$ to approximately $L/S$, where $L$ is the length of the input sequence, and $S$ is the stride length.\n",

    "Time-LLM is a framework that allows any embedding-visible LLM to be used for time series forecasting.\n",
