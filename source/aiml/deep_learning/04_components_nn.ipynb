    "- **Adam**: An adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm that combines the benefits of both AdaGrad and RMSProp.\n",

    "### 7. Learning Rate\n",

    "The learning rate controls the step size of parameter updates during training. It is a hyperparameter that needs to be tuned to balance between training speed and convergence stability.\n",

    "\n",
    "Understanding the components of a neural network is crucial for effectively designing, training, and deploying neural network models. By grasping the roles of neurons, layers, weights, biases, activation functions, loss functions, optimization algorithms, and learning rate, you'll be well-equipped to build and train neural networks for various machine learning tasks. Experimentation and hands-on practice are key to mastering these concepts."
