    "Visualizing computational graphs in PyTorch provides a visual representation of the network architecture and the flow of data through the network. This can be particularly helpful for understanding complex models and debugging neural network architectures. One popular library for visualizing computational graphs in PyTorch is `torchviz`. Let's see how we can use `torchviz` to visualize a computational graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Install `torchviz`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't installed `torchviz` yet, you can install it using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install torchviz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Visualize a Computational Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to visualize a computational graph for a simple neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import torch\n",
    "import torch.nn as nn\n",
    "from torchviz import make_dot\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a simple neural network\n",
    "class SimpleNN(nn.Module):\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        super(SimpleNN, self).__init__()\n",
    "        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 5)\n",
    "        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(5, 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def forward(self, x):\n",
    "        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))\n",
    "        x = self.fc2(x)\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instantiate the model\n",
    "model = SimpleNN()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate a random input\n",
    "input_data = torch.randn(1, 10)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Forward pass\n",
    "output = model(input_data)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Visualize the computational graph\n",
    "make_dot(output, params=dict(model.named_parameters()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The generated visualization will show nodes representing the operations performed by the neural network layers, as well as edges representing the flow of data between the layers. This provides a clear and intuitive representation of how data flows through the network during forward pass.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Save or Display the Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "You can save the visualization to a file or display it directly in your Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Save the visualization to a file\n",
    "make_dot(output, params=dict(model.named_parameters())).render(\"computational_graph\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display the visualization in Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "make_dot(output, params=dict(model.named_parameters()))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizing computational graphs using `torchviz` is a powerful tool for understanding and debugging neural network architectures. By visualizing the network's structure and the flow of data through it, we can gain insights into how the model processes input data and makes predictions. Experimenting with visualization tools like `torchviz` can enhance our understanding of neural networks and help us build more effective models."
