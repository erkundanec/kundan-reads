    "**Data wrangling, imputation, and cleaning** are all essential steps in data preprocessing, but they serve different purposes and involve distinct techniques. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Wrangling\n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "Data wrangling (also called data munging) is the process of transforming raw data into a usable format for analysis. It involves various steps to manipulate, organize, and prepare the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Activities:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Merging or joining datasets  \n",
    "- Reshaping data (e.g., pivoting, melting)  \n",
    "- Filtering and selecting data subsets  \n",
    "- Converting data types (e.g., strings to dates)  \n",
    "- Aggregating or summarizing data  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Combining sales data from multiple regions into a single dataset.  \n",
    "- Restructuring data from wide to long format for easier analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**  \n",
    "To make the data structured and ready for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Imputation**  \n",
    "**Definition:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Imputation is the process of replacing missing or incomplete data with substituted values to maintain dataset integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Techniques:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean/Median/Mode Imputation:** Replace missing values with the average or most frequent value.  \n",
    "- **Forward/Backward Fill:** Use previous or next values in the dataset to fill gaps.  \n",
    "- **Interpolation:** Estimate values based on trends in the data.  \n",
    "- **Model-based Imputation:** Use regression, k-NN, or machine learning to predict missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Filling in missing temperatures in a weather dataset using the average of neighboring values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To handle missing data without losing information or introducing significant bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Data Cleaning**  \n",
    "**Definition:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Data cleaning is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) inaccurate, inconsistent, or irrelevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Activities:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing duplicates  \n",
    "- Handling outliers  \n",
    "- Correcting typos and errors in data entries  \n",
    "- Standardizing formats (e.g., date formats, categorical values)  \n",
    "- Addressing inconsistencies (e.g., \"NY\" vs. \"New York\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Removing duplicate entries in a customer database.  \n",
    "- Converting all date formats to a consistent standard (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the dataset is accurate, consistent, and free from errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary Table\n",
