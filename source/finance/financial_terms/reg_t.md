# Regulation T
### Regulation T

Regulation T is like a rulebook for how people can buy stocks with borrowed money, called buying on margin. It says that if you want to borrow money from a broker to buy stocks, you can only borrow up to 50% of the stock's price. The rest, 50%, you have to pay in cash from your own pocket.

Regulation T, often abbreviated as Reg T, is not a specific entity or group of individuals. Instead, it refers to a set of regulations established by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in the United States. The Federal Reserve is the central banking system of the United States, responsible for regulating monetary policy and overseeing the country's financial system.

Here's a simple breakdown:

1. **Cash Accounts**: If you have a cash account, you can't borrow money from your broker. You have to pay for stocks with the money you already have.

2. **Margin Accounts**: These are special accounts where you can borrow money from your broker to buy stocks. But there's a limit. You can only borrow up to half of what the stocks cost. The other half, you must pay with your own cash.

3. **Preventing Risky Behavior**: Regulation T is there to stop people from getting into too much debt by buying too many stocks with borrowed money. It helps keep things safer for investors.

4. **No Freeriding**: There's also a rule in Regulation T that prevents something called "freeriding." This happens when someone buys and sells stocks before they've actually paid for them. If you do this, your broker can freeze your account for 90 days, meaning you have to pay for your stocks right away when you make a trade.

So, Regulation T is basically about making sure people don't take on too much risk when buying stocks with borrowed money, and it sets some clear rules to keep things fair and safe.
