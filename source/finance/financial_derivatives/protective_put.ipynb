    "\n",
    "**Protective Put** = Long stock + Long put option.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an **insurance-like strategy** where an investor buys a put option to hedge against downside risk in an asset or portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the stock/portfolio rises: You benefit from upside.\n",
    "* If it falls below the put strike: Losses are capped because the put increases in value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overlay**: You apply this put hedge over an existing long portfolio (e.g., SPY or a diversified basket), hence the term **\"protective put overlay.\"**\n",

    "\n",
    "* Limit losses while retaining upside exposure.\n",

    "* **SPY ETF**: Simplest and most liquid.\n",

    "\n",
    "     * ATM (max protection, max cost).\n",
    "     * OTM (cheaper, partial protection).\n",
    "   * **Expiration**:\n",
    "\n",
    "     * 1-3 months (liquid and responsive).\n",
    "     * Longer-dated = more expensive but durable.\n",
    "   * **Sizing**:\n",
    "\n",

    "* Size the hedge according to **risk tolerance**, not full portfolio always.\n",
    "* **Roll** puts before expiration to maintain protection.\n",
    "* Use **liquid, low-spread** options.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ Mistakes to Avoid:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Buying puts too far OTM (false sense of protection).\n",
    "* Over-hedging (kills returns in bull markets).\n",
    "* Not adjusting hedge as portfolio or market changes.\n",
    "* Ignoring cost-to-benefit ratio (e.g., buying protection in low-vol environments can be more efficient).\n",
