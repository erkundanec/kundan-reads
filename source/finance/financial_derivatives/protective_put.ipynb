    "**Protective Put** = Long stock + Long put option.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an **insurance-like strategy** where an investor buys a put option to hedge against downside risk in an asset or portfolio.\n",

    "* If the stock/portfolio rises: You benefit from upside.\n",
    "* If it falls below the put strike: Losses are capped because the put increases in value.\n",
