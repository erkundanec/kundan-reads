    "# Tangency Portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Tangency Portfolio** is a portfolio that maximizes the **Sharpe Ratio**, representing the optimal risk-return trade-off for an investor. It lies on the **Capital Market Line (CML)**, which is a line tangent to the efficient frontier. The Tangency Portfolio includes both risky assets and the risk-free asset and serves as the foundation for constructing the **Optimal Portfolio**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Efficient Frontier\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Efficient Frontier** is a curve representing portfolios that offer the highest possible expected return for each level of risk. The Tangency Portfolio is the portfolio on this frontier that maximizes the Sharpe Ratio, making it the point of highest efficiency for the risk-return trade-off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Capital Market Line (CML)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Capital Market Line** represents all combinations of the risk-free asset and the Tangency Portfolio. The CML starts at the risk-free rate and is tangent to the efficient frontier at the Tangency Portfolio. Every point on this line represents a potential portfolio, with different combinations of risk-free and risky assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Sharpe Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Sharpe Ratio** measures the excess return per unit of risk for a portfolio. The Tangency Portfolio maximizes the Sharpe Ratio, defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{E[R_p] - R_f}{\\sigma_p}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $E[R_p]$ is the expected return of the portfolio,\n",
    "- $R_f$ is the risk-free rate,\n",
    "- $\\sigma_p$ is the standard deviation (risk) of the portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Risk-Free Asset\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an asset with a known return and no risk (often represented by government bonds). By combining the Tangency Portfolio with the risk-free asset, investors can adjust their portfolio’s risk level according to their risk tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How the Tangency Portfolio is Calculated\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tangency Portfolio is found by solving a constrained optimization problem where the goal is to maximize the Sharpe Ratio. This involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expected Returns (Mean Vector)**: An estimation of the expected returns for each asset in the portfolio.\n",
    "2. **Covariance Matrix**: A matrix showing the covariances (and variances) of the assets’ returns, indicating how they interact in terms of risk.\n",
    "3. **Maximizing the Sharpe Ratio**: The optimization goal is to maximize $\\frac{w^T \\mu - R_f}{\\sqrt{w^T \\Sigma w}}$, where $w$ represents asset weights, $\\mu$ is the vector of expected returns, and $\\Sigma$ is the covariance matrix. This maximizes the risk-adjusted return.\n",
    "\n",
    "The weights of the Tangency Portfolio are calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w = \\frac{\\Sigma^{-1}(\\mu - R_f)}{\\mathbf{1}^T \\Sigma^{-1}(\\mu - R_f)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $\\Sigma^{-1}$ is the inverse of the covariance matrix,\n",
    "- $\\mu - R_f$ is the excess return vector over the risk-free rate,\n",
    "- $\\mathbf{1}$ is a vector of ones, ensuring the weights sum to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interpretation and Use\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimal Risk-Return Balance**: The Tangency Portfolio is the portfolio with the best possible risk-adjusted return, making it the theoretically ideal portfolio for any investor willing to adjust their risk with leverage or a risk-free asset.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Investment Strategy**:\n",
    "  - **For Risk-Averse Investors**: They can invest a portion of their wealth in the Tangency Portfolio and the rest in the risk-free asset.\n",
    "  - **For Risk-Seeking Investors**: They may invest in the Tangency Portfolio with leverage, borrowing at the risk-free rate to amplify potential returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Capital Allocation Line (CAL)**: For each investor, the line connecting their portfolio with the risk-free rate is their Capital Allocation Line. The CML represents the ideal CAL when the Tangency Portfolio is combined with the risk-free asset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages and Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages**:\n",
    "  - Maximizes returns for each unit of risk taken.\n",
    "  - Adapts to varying risk preferences, allowing the use of leverage for higher risk/return or risk-free assets for lower risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations**:\n",
    "  - **Dependence on Estimations**: Requires accurate estimates of expected returns and the covariance matrix, which are sensitive to small changes and may be unstable.\n",
    "  - **Risk-Free Rate Assumption**: Assumes availability of a risk-free rate, which may not be realistic over all periods or for all investors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the Tangency Portfolio is central to portfolio theory as it offers the best combination of risky assets, optimizing the Sharpe Ratio and laying the foundation for various investment strategies."
