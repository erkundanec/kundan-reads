    "\n",
    "**Price-to-Free Cash Flow (P/FCF) Ratio:** This is a valuation metric that compares a company's market price to its free cash flow, indicating how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of free cash flow. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{P/FCF Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Market Capitalization}}{\\text{Free Cash Flow}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it can be calculated on a per-share basis as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{P/FCF Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Market Price per Share}}{\\text{Free Cash Flow per Share}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Market Capitalization** is the total market value of the company's outstanding shares.\n",
    "- **Free Cash Flow (FCF)** is the cash generated by the company after accounting for capital expenditures, which is available for debt repayment, dividends, or reinvestment in the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it matters:\n",
    "- A **low P/FCF ratio** suggests that the company may be undervalued relative to its ability to generate cash.\n",
    "- A **high P/FCF ratio** could imply that investors expect high future growth in cash flow, but it may also suggest overvaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "This ratio is often preferred over the P/E ratio because it focuses on cash flow, which is harder to manipulate than earnings."
