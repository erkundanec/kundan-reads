    "The P/E ratio indicates how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings. A **high P/E ratio** suggests that investors expect strong future growth, while a **low P/E ratio** might indicate undervaluation or low growth expectations. The ratio is often compared to industry averages or historical trends to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued."
