    "## Free Cash Flow Yield\n",
    "\n",
    "**Free Cash Flow Yield:** This is a financial metric that measures the amount of free cash flow (FCF) a company generates relative to its market value. It helps investors assess how much cash flow a company is generating compared to its stock price. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Free Cash Flow Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Free Cash Flow}}{\\text{Market Capitalization}} \\times 100\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, it can be calculated on a per-share basis:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Free Cash Flow Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Free Cash Flow per Share}}{\\text{Market Price per Share}} \\times 100\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components:\n",
    "- **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** The cash generated by the company after accounting for capital expenditures.\n",
    "- **Market Capitalization:** The total market value of a company's outstanding shares (calculated as share price multiplied by the number of shares outstanding).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation:\n",
    "- **Higher Free Cash Flow Yield:** Indicates that the company is generating more cash relative to its market value, which might signal undervaluation or strong cash generation potential.\n",
    "- **Lower Free Cash Flow Yield:** Suggests the company is generating less cash relative to its market value, which could indicate overvaluation or inefficiency in converting profits into cash.\n",
    "\n",
    "This metric is often used to compare companies' cash generation ability and is especially useful for value investors."

    "## How much correlation between P/FCF and Free Cash Flow Yield\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Price-to-Free Cash Flow (P/FCF) Ratio** and **Free Cash Flow Yield** are essentially **inversely related** and thus highly correlated. Specifically, the relationship between these two metrics is a **mirror image** in terms of how they are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Relationship:\n",
    "1. **P/FCF Ratio:**\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{P/FCF Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Market Capitalization}}{\\text{Free Cash Flow (FCF)}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Free Cash Flow Yield:**\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\text{Free Cash Flow Yield} = \\frac{\\text{Free Cash Flow}}{\\text{Market Capitalization}} \\times 100\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point here is that the **P/FCF ratio** is the **inverse** of the **Free Cash Flow Yield** when expressed in the same units (i.e., per-share or total market capitalization). \n",
    "\n",
    "- If a company's **P/FCF ratio** is high, it indicates that the company is being valued at a high multiple of its free cash flow, suggesting lower **Free Cash Flow Yield** (less cash flow per dollar of investment).\n",
    "- Conversely, a **low P/FCF ratio** indicates a lower valuation relative to free cash flow, which suggests a **higher Free Cash Flow Yield** (more cash flow per dollar of investment).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation:\n",
    "- The correlation between **P/FCF ratio** and **Free Cash Flow Yield** is generally **negative** and close to **-1** because one is simply the inverse of the other.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  In practical terms, this means:\n",
    "  - When **P/FCF ratio** increases (the company becomes more expensive relative to its cash flow), the **Free Cash Flow Yield** decreases.\n",
    "  - When **P/FCF ratio** decreases (the company becomes cheaper relative to its cash flow), the **Free Cash Flow Yield** increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of the inverse relationship:\n",
    "- If a company's **P/FCF ratio** is 20, this implies it is trading at 20 times its free cash flow, suggesting a **low free cash flow yield** (around 5% if you invert it: 1/20).\n",
    "- If the **P/FCF ratio** drops to 10, this suggests a **higher free cash flow yield** (around 10%, because 1/10 = 10%).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "The **correlation between the P/FCF ratio and Free Cash Flow Yield** is **strongly negative** because they are **inverse** metrics, both providing complementary insights into how a companyâ€™s valuation compares to its ability to generate cash flow."
