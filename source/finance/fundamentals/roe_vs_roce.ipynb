    "### **ROE (Return on Equity) vs. ROCE (Return on Capital Employed)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both **ROE** and **ROCE** are profitability ratios, but they measure returns on different parts of a company's capital and cater to distinct perspectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. ROE (Return on Equity)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**:  \n",
    "ROE measures how effectively a company generates profits using the **shareholders’ equity**. It shows the return earned on the money invested by shareholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Formula**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Profit (PAT)}}{\\text{Shareholders' Equity}} \\times 100\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Focus**:  \n",
    "- Focuses **only** on equity shareholders' returns.  \n",
    "- Ignores debt or borrowed funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. ROCE (Return on Capital Employed)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Definition**:  \n",
    "ROCE measures the overall profitability and efficiency of a company in generating returns using **total capital employed**, which includes both equity and debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Formula**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ROCE} = \\frac{\\text{Operating Profit (EBIT)}}{\\text{Capital Employed}} \\times 100\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Capital Employed} = \\text{Total Assets} - \\text{Current Liabilities}\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "Or:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Capital Employed} = \\text{Shareholders' Equity} + \\text{Long-term Debt}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Focus**:  \n",
    "- Considers returns on **both equity and debt** capital.  \n",
    "- Reflects the company’s efficiency in using all available capital.\n",

    "| **Metric**           | **ROE (Return on Equity)**                          | **ROCE (Return on Capital Employed)**                   |\n",

    "| **Formula Base**     | Uses **Net Profit (PAT)**.                           | Uses **Operating Profit (EBIT)**.                     |\n",
    "| **Capital Base**     | Considers only **Shareholders’ Equity**.             | Considers **Equity + Long-term Debt** (Capital Employed). |\n",
    "| **Perspective**      | Reflects profitability from shareholders’ viewpoint. | Reflects overall operational efficiency.               |\n",
    "| **Leverage Impact**  | Leverage (debt) can boost ROE artificially.          | ROCE accounts for the cost of debt, offering a balanced view. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **When to Use ROE vs. ROCE**\n",
    "1. **ROE**: Focus on shareholder returns. Useful when analyzing companies with low or no debt.  \n",
    "2. **ROCE**: Evaluate the efficiency of total capital utilization, especially important for companies with significant debt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**:\n",
    "#### Given:  \n",
    "- **Net Profit (PAT)**: \\$50 million  \n",
    "- **Operating Profit (EBIT)**: \\$70 million  \n",
    "- **Shareholders' Equity**: \\$200 million  \n",
    "- **Total Assets**: \\$500 million  \n",
    "- **Current Liabilities**: \\$100 million  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **ROE**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ROE} = \\frac{50,000,000}{200,000,000} \\times 100 = 25\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **ROCE**:  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Capital Employed} = 500,000,000 - 100,000,000 = 400,000,000\n",
    "$$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{ROCE} = \\frac{70,000,000}{400,000,000} \\times 100 = 17.5\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**:\n",
    "- **ROE** is higher (25%) as it focuses on equity returns.  \n",
    "- **ROCE** is slightly lower (17.5%) as it considers the cost of capital employed (debt + equity).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both metrics offer valuable insights, but **ROCE** provides a more holistic view of operational efficiency."
