## Introduction
Managed futures involve the active management of a portfolio of futures contracts by professional investors. This investment strategy is considered an alternative approach, often favored by funds and institutional investors seeking to achieve both portfolio and market diversification.

The primary advantage of managed futures lies in their ability to provide portfolio diversification. This is achieved by offering exposure to various asset classes, thereby helping to mitigate overall portfolio risk. Unlike direct capital investments such as stocks and bonds, managed futures contribute to a more resilient and well-rounded investment portfolio.

The performance of managed futures typically exhibits a weak or inverse correlation with traditional stock and bond markets. This unique characteristic makes them an attractive choice for investors looking to enhance the diversification of their portfolios, aligning with the principles of modern portfolio theory.

To delve into the realm of managed futures, it is essential to understand their functioning, trading strategies, fee structures, and identify the top-performing managed future ETFs for potential investment. 

<!-- Additionally, we will assess the viability of investing in these instruments. -->

<!-- Firstly, managed futures refer to investment strategies involving the active trading of futures contracts across various asset classes. This proactive approach allows investors to capitalize on both rising and falling markets. The beauty of managed futures lies in their **ability to maintain a low correlation with conventional assets**, like stocks, which can enhance portfolio diversification.

In terms of trading strategies, managed futures employ a variety of approaches, such as trend following, mean reversion, and countertrend strategies. These methods aim to exploit market trends and deviations to generate profits.

Understanding the fee structure is crucial for investors considering managed futures. Typically, fees involve a combination of management fees and performance fees. Management fees cover the cost of overseeing the portfolio, while performance fees are based on the returns generated. Investors should carefully evaluate these fees to ensure they align with their investment goals.

Now, let's explore the top managed future ETFs that have demonstrated consistent performance and stability. These ETFs provide investors with a convenient way to access the managed futures market while maintaining liquidity and transparency.

Lastly, the decision of whether to invest in managed futures depends on individual risk tolerance, investment objectives, and market outlook. While the potential for lucrative returns exists, investors should carefully weigh the risks associated with these strategies.

In conclusion, managed futures offer a unique investment opportunity due to their low correlation with traditional assets and potential for attractive returns. By gaining insights into their functioning, trading strategies, fee structures, and identifying promising ETFs, investors can make informed decisions about integrating managed futures into their investment portfolios. -->

## How managed futures works?
Managed futures represent alternative investment opportunities primarily focused on trading in the futures market. A managed futures fund (MFF) or managed futures account (MFA) is overseen by a manager other than the account owner, typically a regulated entity such as a commodity trading advisor (CTA) or a commodity pool operator (CPO), subject to oversight by the National Futures Association and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the USA.

The investment portfolio of managed futures managers typically includes futures contracts spanning various asset classes, such as stock index futures, commodity futures, foreign currency futures, and fixed income futures. In a managed futures program, the traded amount is usually proportional to the investor's principal amount. Alternatively, some may opt for a notional funding approach, wherein only a portion of the minimum required investment is contributed.


## Managed futures vs Hedge funds
It's important to distinguish managed futures from hedge funds, as they differ in the markets they operate in. Managed futures are confined to futures and forward markets, while hedge funds can be traded over the counter and across various global markets.

## Trading Strategies and different fees
Turning to trading strategies, managed futures employ diverse approaches like trend following, mean reversion, and countertrend strategies. These strategies aim to capitalize on market trends and deviations for profit generation.

Several trading strategies can be employed in managed futures investments, each with its own characteristics:

1. **Trend Following Strategy:**
   Trend-following strategies aim to generate profits through long or short positions based on fundamental and/or technical market signals. When an asset's price exhibits a downward trend, trend traders may opt for a short position. Conversely, during an upward trend, they may take a long position. The strategy involves analyzing diverse indicators, determining the asset's direction, and executing trades accordingly to capture gains.

2. **Market-Neutral Strategy:**
   This approach focuses on investments that remain unaffected by fluctuations in stock and bond markets. Market-neutral strategies aim to capitalize on pricing inefficiencies, leveraging spreads and arbitrage opportunities. Investors employing this strategy seek to manage market risk by concurrently taking matching long and short positions within a specific industry. The goal is to profit from both upward and downward price movements.

3. **Discretionary Strategy:**
   This method entails investment decisions made by the commodity trading advisor or fund manager based on real-time market data and their discretion.

4. **Systematic Strategy:**
   In this strategy, investment decisions are derived from trends or patterns observed in historical charts, relying on systematic analysis.

Regarding fees associated with managed futures accounts, there are two primary types:

1. **Management Fee:**
   Ranging from 0% to approximately 3% per annum, this fee is contingent on the specific program in which you invest and the experience of your fund manager.

2. **Performance Fee (Incentive Fee):**
   This fee is payable to the fund manager when profits are realized and typically falls within the range of 20% to 30%.

Now, when considering which managed futures options to invest in, it's essential to conduct thorough research and consider factors such as the fund's historical performance, the expertise of the fund manager, and alignment with your investment goals and risk tolerance.

In conclusion, a comprehensive understanding of the diverse trading strategies available, coupled with careful consideration of associated fees and informed research on specific managed futures options, will aid in making well-informed investment decisions.

## How to create an strategy for managed future?
Creating a strategy for managed futures involves a systematic approach that takes into account various factors such as market analysis, risk management, and trading rules. Managed futures typically involve trading financial instruments such as futures contracts across different asset classes like commodities, currencies, and financial indices. Here's a general guide to help you develop a managed futures strategy:

1. **Define Objectives and Constraints:**
   - Clearly outline your investment objectives, whether it's capital appreciation, income generation, or risk mitigation.
   - Identify any constraints, such as risk tolerance, liquidity needs, and regulatory requirements.

2. **Market Analysis:**
   - Conduct thorough research on the markets you plan to trade, considering both fundamental and technical analysis.
   - Identify trends, market conditions, and potential catalysts that may impact the chosen asset classes.

3. **Asset Allocation:**
   - Diversify across different asset classes to spread risk. Managed futures often involve trading in commodities, currencies, interest rates, and equity indices.
   - Consider the correlation between different assets to ensure a well-balanced portfolio.

4. **Risk Management:**
   - Establish risk parameters, including stop-loss levels and position sizes, to protect your capital.
   - Use risk management tools such as value at risk (VaR) and stress testing to assess the potential impact of adverse market conditions.

5. **Systematic Approach:**
   - Develop a systematic trading approach with well-defined entry and exit rules.
   - Consider using quantitative models, algorithms, or technical indicators to guide trading decisions.

6. **Backtesting:**
   - Backtest your strategy using historical data to evaluate its performance under different market conditions.
   - Identify potential weaknesses and refine the strategy based on backtesting results.

7. **Monitoring and Adjustments:**
   - Regularly monitor the performance of your strategy and adjust it based on changing market conditions.
   - Stay informed about economic indicators, geopolitical events, and other factors that may impact the markets.

8. **Technology and Infrastructure:**
   - Invest in reliable technology infrastructure to execute trades efficiently.
   - Utilize trading platforms and tools that provide real-time data and analytics.

9. **Compliance and Regulation:**
   - Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements and stay informed about changes in regulations that may affect your trading strategy.

## Benefits of Managed Futures and CTAs

1. **Crisis Alpha:**
   - Coined by investment analyst Kathryn M. Kaminski, "crisis alpha" refers to the tendency of managed futures to perform relatively well during market downturns. Positioned as a tail-risk strategy, managed futures aim to provide downside protection in portfolios, minimizing capital losses during significant market declines while maintaining somewhat reduced performance in bullish market periods.

2. **Portfolio Diversification:**
   - Managed futures have demonstrated their value in portfolio diversification, particularly during crises when traditional assets like stocks and bonds face challenges. This diversification benefit is especially notable in inflationary periods, where managed futures can focus on specific commodities or foreign currencies, offering a hedge against the impact on traditional equities and bonds.

3. **Flexibility:**
   - The trend-following nature of managed futures allows these funds to potentially capitalize on both upward and downward market trends. This flexibility enhances their ability to navigate diverse market conditions.

These benefits showcase the potential advantages that managed futures and Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs) can bring to investors, including crisis resilience, portfolio diversification, and adaptability to market trends.


## Downsides of Managed Futures and CTAs

1. **Dependence on Clear Market Trends:**
   - The effectiveness of Commodity Trading Advisor (CTA) strategies is closely tied to market conditions. In markets lacking clear trends, these strategies may be less effective. Ironically, this is often when investors seek assistance from managed funds.

2. **Manager Performance:**
   - Some managed futures funds showcase high returns (alpha); however, studies indicate that these returns are often attributed to trend-following strategies rather than unique managerial skills. Accounting for these strategies tends to diminish the exceptional performance of many managers.

3. **Fees and Other Costs:**
   - CTAs impose transaction and management fees that can significantly impact net returns, particularly during periods when managed futures compete with less risky investments like Treasurys. The presence of these fees can be a notable drawback for investors.

These downsides underscore challenges associated with managed futures and CTAs, including their reliance on market trends, the role of trend-following strategies in performance, and the impact of fees on overall returns.


Remember that managed futures trading involves inherent risks, and past performance is not indicative of future results. Consider consulting with financial professionals and conducting thorough due diligence before implementing any trading strategy. Additionally, it may be beneficial to start with smaller capital and gradually scale up as you gain confidence in your strategy.
