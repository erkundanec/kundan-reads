## How to know my mysql username?
To find out your MySQL username, you can follow these steps:

### 1. MySQL Workbench:

If you have MySQL Workbench installed, you can use it to view your MySQL user accounts.

1. Open MySQL Workbench.
2. In the Home tab, you'll find a section called "MySQL Connections." Select the connection you want to check or connect to your MySQL server if you haven't connected yet.
3. Once connected, you'll see the Navigator on the left side. Under the "Navigator" pane, click on the "Administration" tab.
4. In the Administration tab, click on "Users and Privileges."
5. Here, you'll see a list of MySQL users. Look for your username in the list. Default username is "root".

If you have access to the MySQL command-line client, you can use it to check the current user.

1. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell.
2. Navigate to the MySQL bin directory (if not already in your PATH).

   ```bash
   cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
   ```

   Replace the path with the actual path where MySQL is installed on your system.

3. Connect to the MySQL server.

   ```bash
   mysql -h localhost -u root -p
   ```

   Replace "root" with your MySQL username if it's different.

4. Enter your MySQL password when prompted.

5. Once connected, you can check the current user using the following SQL query:

   ```sql
   SELECT CURRENT_USER;
   ```

   This will display the current MySQL username.

Remember that the default MySQL username during installation is often "root." If you have a different username, it should be specified during the installation process or available in the MySQL configuration files.
