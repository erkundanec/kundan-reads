# SEO and Content Writing
## Introduction

In today’s digital world, content writing and SEO content writing are two of the most impactful ways to communicate, yet they serve different purposes. A key distinction between them is the use of keywords.

Regular content writing typically doesn’t involve keyword research and isn’t focused on search rankings. In contrast, SEO content writing is built around thorough keyword research and a strategy aimed at achieving higher rankings in search engine results, making the content more discoverable to readers.
