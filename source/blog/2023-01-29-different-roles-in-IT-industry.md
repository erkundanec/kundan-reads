## Full-Stack Developer
A full-stack developer is a professional who has expertise in both frontend and backend development, meaning they are proficient in working with both the client-side and server-side of a web application. The term "stack" refers to the combination of technologies and tools used in both frontend and backend development. A full-stack developer is capable of handling all aspects of web development, from designing user interfaces to managing databases and server-side logic.

Here's a breakdown of the two main components of full-stack development:

1. **Frontend Development:**
   - Involves the creation of the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX).
   - Uses technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Deals with how the application looks and interacts with users.

2. **Backend Development:**
   - Involves server-side logic, databases, and application architecture.
   - Manages data and business logic.
   - Uses server-side languages like Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, or Node.js, and works with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.

Full-stack developers are versatile and can work on both ends of the development spectrum. They are able to contribute to the entire development process, from planning and design to implementation and maintenance. This versatility makes them valuable in smaller development teams or startup environments where individuals may need to wear multiple hats.
