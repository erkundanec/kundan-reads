## How to use docusaurus

## Start Docusaurus project
To install Docusaurus on another system after cloning the repository, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Node.js and npm are installed**: Docusaurus is built using Node.js, so you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

2. **Navigate to the cloned repository**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have cloned the Docusaurus repository.

3. **Install dependencies**: Docusaurus relies on various dependencies which are listed in the `package.json` file. To install these dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

   This command will download and install all the necessary packages specified in the `package.json` file.

4. **Start the development server**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server to preview your Docusaurus site locally. Run the following command:

    ```
    npm start
    ```
    or

    ```
    npm run start
    ```

   This command will start a local development server, and you should be able to view your Docusaurus site by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

That's it! You have now installed Docusaurus on your system and can start working with your project locally.
